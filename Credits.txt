Sprites used in this repository are from the talented ElizaWy (https://github.com/ElizaWy/LPC) and others from the Creative Commons community + volunteers at OpenGameArt.org.
Thanks to them, I can focus on the technical side of things and make myself a better developer and create my dream game.

Hello and welcome to the LPC Revised collection!

This pack is licensed OGA-BY 3.0. This means you can use these graphics free of charge, even for commercial use, so long as the artists are credited.
